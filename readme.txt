Lets your users make the WordPress admin dashboard darker.

== Description ==

This is a beta plugin that might one day be part of the WordPress core. Please don't use this on production websites unless you're happy with the stability as some things may still be experimental.

Using technology at night time can have a negative effect on your eyesight. Dark Mode will darken the colors of your admin dashboard making it easier for you to work at night.

For information on the progress of this plugin, please refer to the [Trac ticket](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41928) or you can get involved on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/danieltj27/Dark-Mode).

= Developers =

As some plugins make use of custom stylesheets, you can use the `doing_dark_mode` action hook to include a custom stylesheet that supports Dark Mode for your own plugin interfaces when it's enabled. Alternatively you can use the `dark_mode_css` filter hook to change the Dark Mode stylesheet for your own version if you'd prefer.

= Translators =

Whilst Dark Mode has been translated into a few different languages already, we need your help! If you have just five minutes to spare, please consider [translating Dark Mode](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/dark-mode) into your language today.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin package to the plugins directory.
2. Login to the dashboard and activate the plugin.
3. Go to your profile and enable Dark Mode.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do? =

By default, WordPress has a very bright color scheme which means working at night time can be difficult. Dark Mode allows you to change the overall design to a much darker and subtle design making it more visually pleasing when working late.

= When does Dark Mode start working? =

You can set Dark Mode to come on automatically between two set times, or have it enabled all the time. Go to your profile page and edit your settings accordingly.

= Can I contribute to this plugin? =

Yes, you can follow the [Trac ticket](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41928) for updates and get involved on [GitHub](https://github.com/danieltj27/Dark-Mode) with suggestions, feedback and code contributions.
